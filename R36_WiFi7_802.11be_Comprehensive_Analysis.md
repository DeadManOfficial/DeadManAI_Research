## 2. MULTI-LINK OPERATION (MLO)

### 2.1 Definition and Architecture

**Multi-Link Operation (MLO)** is a mandatory 802.11be feature enabling a single client device to simultaneously maintain connections to one access point across multiple frequency bands and channel widths.

**Architectural Requirement:** Unlike firmware updates in previous WiFi generations, MLO requires fundamental hardware redesign in both access points and client devices. It cannot be retrofitted to WiFi 6/6E hardware.

### 2.2 Operating Modes

MLO supports three distinct operational modes, selected automatically by the device based on network conditions:

#### Mode 1: Link Redundancy (Duplicated Transmission)
- **Operation:** Identical data transmitted on 2.4 GHz AND 5 GHz/6 GHz simultaneously
- **Purpose:** Maximum reliability in high-interference or mobile scenarios
- **Receiver Behavior:** Combines frames using diversity combining; if one copy corrupted, receiver has backup
- **Throughput Impact:** No increase (identical traffic on both links)
- **Latency Benefit:** Significant—faster first-attempt success rate
- **Use Case:** Mission-critical video calls, real-time applications, high-motion environments

#### Mode 2: Link Aggregation (Simultaneous Transmission)
- **Operation:** Different data fragments split between 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz/6 GHz
- **Purpose:** Maximum throughput by parallel transmission
- **Throughput Result:** Theoretical 2x increase (aggregated bandwidth)
- **Latency Impact:** Reduced (parallel processing)
- **Capability Requirement:** Simultaneous Transmit/Receive (STR) capable access point
- **Use Case:** File transfers, large downloads, bandwidth-intensive applications

#### Mode 3: Link Selection (Intelligent Switching)
- **Operation:** Device chooses optimal band in real-time based on SNR, interference, and congestion
- **Decision Criteria:** Signal quality, channel occupancy, historical success rates
- **Latency Impact:** Minimal—switching typically sub-millisecond
- **Throughput Impact:** Near-optimal for current conditions
- **Use Case:** Standard internet browsing, adaptive streaming
- **Most Common Mode:** ~80% of MLO operation in typical networks

### 2.3 MLO Implementation Variants

**MLMR-STR (Multi-Link Multi-Radio, Simultaneous Transmit/Receive):**
- Multiple radio chains per device
- Can transmit and receive on different bands concurrently
- Highest throughput potential (up to 2x in aggregation mode)
- Typically found in high-end laptops, gaming devices, WiFi 7 access points
- Power consumption: Higher (all radios active)

**EMLSR (Enhanced Multi-Link Single Radio):**
- Single radio chain per band with rapid switching
- Transmit/receive on only one band at a time
- ~100-200 microsecond switching latency
- Most common in smartphones (power efficiency trade-off)
- Power consumption: Lower (only active radio consumes power)

### 2.4 Performance Data (Validated Testing)

**Cisco Lab Test Results** (Qualcomm QCN7800 clients on WiFi 7 APs):
- **WiFi 6 Control:** 506 Mbps average throughput
- **WiFi 7 with MLO:** 747 Mbps average throughput
- **Performance Gain:** 47% improvement with single device
- **Test Duration:** Extended sustained load (not burst)
- **Methodology:** Single client, controlled interference environment

**Real-World Variance:** Actual improvements range 30-60% depending on:
- Number of concurrent devices
- Interference levels
- Access point hardware quality
- Client device MLO implementation
- Network infrastructure (switch, router capacity)

## 3. 320 MHz CHANNELS AND SPECTRAL EFFICIENCY

### 3.1 Channel Width Specifications

| Standard | Max Width | 6 GHz Slots | Notes |
|----------|-----------|------------|-------|
| WiFi 6E | 160 MHz | 1 slot per channel | Contiguous only |
| WiFi 7 | 320 MHz | 2 slots | Requires 1200 MHz spectrum |
| WiFi 7 Alt | 240 MHz | 1.5 slots | Contiguous or 160+80 |
| WiFi 7 Alt | 160+160 MHz | 2 slots (non-contiguous) | Flexible placement |

### 3.2 Contiguous Channel Deployment

In regions with full 1200 MHz 6 GHz spectrum availability (North America, most of EU):
- **Channel Set A:** 6425-6745 MHz (320 MHz wide)
- **Channel Set B:** 6745-7065 MHz (320 MHz wide)
- **Channel Set C:** 7065-7385 MHz (320 MHz wide)

**Three simultaneous non-overlapping 320 MHz channels possible per access point cluster.**

### 3.3 Practical Deployment Limitations

**Regional Spectrum Variation:**
- **United States:** Full 1200 MHz (optimal for 320 MHz deployment)
- **European Union:** Variable—some countries 500-1200 MHz (limits channel width)
- **Asia-Pacific:** Range 500-1200 MHz (region-specific)
- **Middle East, Africa:** Minimal (160 MHz typical)

**Resolution:** Check local spectrum regulations before designing 320 MHz deployment—it's not globally available.

### 3.4 Preamble Puncturing (Mandatory)

**Purpose:** Intelligent interference avoidance within wide channels

**Mechanism:** When interference detected in specific sub-channels, WiFi 7 AP "punctures" (ignores) those sub-channels and shifts data to clean portions of the same 320 MHz channel.

**Benefit:** Avoids channel switching overhead while mitigating localized interference

**Example:** 320 MHz channel with radar detected in 40 MHz segment → system operates on remaining 280 MHz without requiring clients to switch channels

**Practical Impact:** Significantly improves 6 GHz reliability in regions with shared spectrum usage

## 4. 4K-QAM (4096-QAM) MODULATION

### 4.1 Technical Foundation

**QAM Encoding Comparison:**

| Standard | Modulation | Bits/Symbol | SNR Required | Range Limitation |
|----------|-----------|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| WiFi 6 | 1024-QAM | 10 bits | ~38 dB SNR | Standard room |
| WiFi 7 | 4096-QAM | 12 bits | ~42 dB SNR | 5-15 feet |

**Throughput Impact:** 2 additional bits per symbol = 20% theoretical improvement when active

**Trade-off:** Requires proximity (high SNR = close to AP)

### 4.2 MCS Rates 12-13 Implementation

WiFi 7 introduces two new modulation coding schemes:
- **MCS 12:** 4096-QAM with 3/4 code rate
- **MCS 13:** 4096-QAM with 5/6 code rate

These are **optional for certification**—vendors can choose not to implement.

### 4.3 Real-World Applicability

**When Used:**
- Devices within 5-15 feet of AP
- High-density meeting rooms (clients need boost over competitors)
- Gaming/streaming setup (client sits at desk)
- Desktop workstations (fixed position)

**When Avoided:**
- Mobile clients (moving reduces SNR)
- Legacy interference environments (>42 dB SNR hard to achieve)
- Coverage-focused deployments (sacrifices range)

**Recommendation:** Not critical for enterprise deployments. Standard WiFi 7 (without 4K-QAM) sufficient for 95%+ of use cases.
