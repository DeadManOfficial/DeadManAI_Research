[![Standards](https://img.shields.io/badge/Standards-NASA_NPR-orange?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/DeadManOfficial/DeadManAI_Research)
[![3-Factor](https://img.shields.io/badge/Validated-3--Factor_Ruling-success?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/DeadManOfficial/DeadManAI_Research)

**100+ research documents following NASA standards. Every source validated. Implementation-ready.**

*The knowledge base behind DeadManAI Framework.*

## Why Use This?

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Research is scattered and unstructured | **NASA-standard format** - 11+ sections per document |
| No way to validate AI tool recommendations | **3-Factor Ruling** - Human-in-Loop, Retention, Reusability |
| Research doesn't translate to implementation | **Production-ready templates** included with every doc |
| Hard to find what's relevant | **Master index** with categories and quick references |

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/DeadManOfficial/DeadManAI_Research.git
cd DeadManAI_Research

# Start with the index
cat 00_RESEARCH_INDEX.md
```

---

## Research Categories

| Range | Category | Documents |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| **R01-R12** | Foundation & Production | Niche, strategy, script, visual, audio, publish |
| **R13-R18** | LLM Reasoning | Tree-of-Thought, ReAct, Graph-of-Thought |
| **R19-R27** | Video Generation | JSON2Video, Replicate, TurboDiffusion |
| **R28-R35** | AI Infrastructure | Fabric patterns, prompt engineering |
| **R36-R62** | Network & Systems | WiFi 7, QoS, SDN, remote production |

## Document Structure (11+ Sections)

Every research document includes:

```
1. Paper Overview        - Citation, abstract, prior work
2. Core Problem          - What limitation does this solve?
3. Proposed Framework    - Concept, components, process
4. Experimental Results  - Benchmarks, data, performance
5. Framework Application - DeadManAI-specific use cases
6. Implementation        - Templates, when to use
7. Compliance Check      - 3-Factor Ruling assessment
8. Limitations           - Considerations and mitigations
9. Source Citations      - Full bibliography
10. Key Takeaways        - 20+ numbered insights
11. Integration Status   - Priorities, next steps
```

## 3-Factor Ruling

Every source is validated before integration:

| Factor | Question | Requirement |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Human-in-Loop** | Does human direct, not AI? | MUST PASS |
| **Retention Velocity** | Does it improve content quality? | MUST PASS |
| **Asset Reusability** | Does it create lasting value? | MUST PASS |

**Scoring:**
- 3/3 = **FULL INTEGRATION** - Production ready
- 2/3 = **INFORMATIONAL** - Partial value
- 1/3 or 0/3 = **REJECT** - No integration

## Featured Research

### Planning with Files (R37-R38)

**Manus-style context engineering for AI agents**
- File-based planning (task_plan.md, notes.md, deliverable.md)
- Attention manipulation for 50+ tool calls without drift
- Validated by Meta's $2B Manus acquisition

### WiFi 7 & QoS (R36)

**Next-generation wireless for streaming**
- 802.11be analysis with Multi-Link Operation
- WMM QoS configuration for production
- Latency < 5ms targets

### Network Infrastructure (R61-R62)

**Professional network design**
- Remote video production networks
- Software-defined networking (SDN)
- QoS optimization for 4K streaming

## Research Workflow

```
INTAKE → FETCH → ANALYZE → CONTEXTUALIZE → DOCUMENT → INDEX → IMPLEMENT → AUDIT → REPEAT
```
